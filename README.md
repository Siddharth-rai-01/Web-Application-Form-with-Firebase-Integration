# Web-Application-Form-with-Firebase-Integration
The "Web Application Form with Firebase Integration" project is an implementation that combines HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase's Realtime Database to create a dynamic and interactive web form. This project enables users to input data through the form, which is then stored and managed in the Firebase database in real-time.
